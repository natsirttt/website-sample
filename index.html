            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a graduate of <b>Computer Engineering</b>, a field that has always captivated me with its blend of <b>innovation</b> and <b>problem-solving</b>. Throughout my academic journey, I immersed myself in the complexities of integrating software and hardware, constantly seeking to deepen my understanding of the digital world. My passion for technology was evident not only in my academic pursuits but also in everything I do such as report automation using excel helping business to have a visual understanding of how much their company gaining profit. During my time in college, I took on the role of a student leader, driven by a desire to contribute positively to the community and as an evident of my passion for helping other people. As a city scholar, where I learn to value more responsibility balancing academic, personal and social life.
            </p>
            <p>
                After graduating, I was honored to be invited by my school to participate in a year-long incubation program for startups while also being an Executive Assistant. This experience provided me with invaluable insights into the world of entrepreneurship, where I learned the importance of effective communication, time management, and organizational skills. Throughout the program, I supported various aspects of startup operations, from managing schedules and coordinating meetings to assisting with project management tasks and providing administrative support to team members. This hands-on experience equipped me with the practical skills and problem-solving abilities necessary to thrive in fast-paced and dynamic environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, my time in the incubation program deepened my understanding of the crucial role that virtual and executive assistants play in supporting the success of businesses, particularly in the digital age. I witnessed firsthand how skilled assistants can streamline workflows, enhance productivity, and facilitate seamless communication between team members and stakeholders. Inspired by these observations, I am eager to leverage my diverse skill set and passion for organization and efficiency to excel in a virtual/executive assistant role.
